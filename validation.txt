pos	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
neg	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
neg	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
neg	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
neg	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
neg	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
neg	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
neg	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
neg	Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!
neu	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
neu	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
neg	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, "these guys are mega wicked chill" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.

neu	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
neu	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
pos	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
neu	Many reviews refer to battery power issues.
pos	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
neu	I also read on Gateway's web site that they specifically recommend the nickel (NiMH)AA batteries rather than alkaline.
neu	They additionally suggest that lithium AA batteries be used for longer life, although they note that these are more expensive.
pos	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
neg	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
neg	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the "Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit." Good luck finding such a kit!
neg	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.
neg	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
neu	So, I called Gateway.
neg	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
neg	Yeah, right.
neg	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
neu	I contacted Gateway tech services again by live chat, and the tech said that they don't have the kit in stock, but promised to call me within 2 weeks to let me know when it would be available.
neg	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
neu	BUT, for anyone who is looking for the Gateway digital camera accessory kit, I did succeed in obtaining it on eBay from an electronics dealer in California (the other side of the country from where I live) that had 110 kits in stock!
neu	(No wonder Gateway doesn't have any left!)
neu	For $20 plus $8 for S & H, I received not only the AC adapter, but another battery charger, another pair of batteries, a small tripod, and a camera cover.
neg	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
neg	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
neg	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
neg	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
neg	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
neu	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.

neu	Having just switched from ADSL to NTL cable broadband I needed a new router to replace the Speedtouch Wireless router that came free with my ADSL connection.
neu	The reviews for this were good, as was the price so I took the plunge.
neu	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
pos	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
neg	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
neu	I've set up even larger Mac only networks so I know what I'm doing.
neg	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
neg	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
neu	I haven't even attempted to get the other machines online yet.
neg	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
neg	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.

videogames_pos_39
pos	"Innovative" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
pos	Very addictive!
neu	There is a steep learning curve in this game, which can only partly be compensated by starting off with weak enemies.
neu	When you play against weak foes, you will not really be "tested."
neu	You will just get an easier game.
neg	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
neg	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
neg	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is "very challenging," aka "painful."
neg	You may win one out of ten tries.
neg	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
pos	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
neu	Considering the fragile male ego, I would think that most guys want to feel smarter than the game-in-the-box, and would simply give up on this game.
neu	Girls are welcome to try of course!
neu	True strategy aficionados (and a few sado-masochists) will take this routine humiliation as a challenge and rack their brains to figure out a better way to play, but ultimately a player's choices are limited--and sometimes you are simply doomed.
neu	One thing I can say for sure: If you get a bad starting location, you will never overcome it, no matter how hard you try.
neg	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
neu	EARLY GAME STRATEGY TIPS Best starting politics is either pacifist or populist.
neu	Speed is a good primary enhancement, plus diplomacy and influence.
neu	Speed is very useful at the beginning, whereas influence and diplomacy have strong effects later on.
neu	You need to start in a location which is relatively unoccupied by potential enemies, and land grab like crazy.
neu	This means 100% or 66% military spending (for colony ships) and zero social spending for 10 or 20 turns.
neu	Try to build a couple more survey ships for a quick boost to your stats and possible early attack capability.
neu	If you have a nearby competitor, use your survey ships (if they procure attack capability, a matter of luck) to wipe out colony ships and other survey ships to secure your sector of the galaxy.
neu	Early wars are soon forgotten and do not affect your alignment.
neu	Usually the entire galaxy gets occupied quickly, but sometimes there will be a "backwater" of stars which is too far from all comers for direct colonization.
neu	The secret is to build a space station (or a chain of them) to bridge the gap and get your colonists over there.
neu	That backwater is likely the safest location in the game.
neu	Once established, you have to adapt your strategy depending on your relative location and alignment.
pos	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
pos	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
neu	I don't think I want to pay $40 for that "privilege."

pos	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
neu	The ones that possess and fight for both of these are namely his loving family led by the patriarchal Federico (Milian), a good man of professorial status at the university and his caring wife Dona Cecilia (Perkins), who still insist their family meet for Sunday dinners promptly at six o'clock with no excuses.
neu	Those providing the turmoil are his brothers Luis and Ricardo (Carbonell and Murciano respectively) who consistently are chomping at the bit with their disputes about the impending revolution and the desire to remain a patriot despite the odds of Communism infiltrating the masses.
neu	Fico remains the peacekeeper and will not tolerate any disrespect towards his decent-hearted father but the dam will only hold for so long as the siblings go their separate ways.
neu	When Luis is killed in an attempted coup-de-tat assassination on loathed Presidente Batista (Fernandez) Fico can only see the writing on the wall when he allows his heart to open to Luis' widow, the beautiful Aurora (Sastre); the two fall in love and marry.
neu	Shortly thereafter things get worse when Ricardo has fled to the deep jungles of the covert military ops of Fidel Castro after he was arrested and beaten by the corrupt chief of police, the vile hand crop bearing Colonel Candela (Mechosa) who has slain Luis. Fico knows this but is powerless to do anything, which makes the tragedy unfolding even more devastating for him to burden himself with.
pos	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
neu	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
neu	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a "Casablanca" tinged melodrama or a "Godfather" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
neu	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed "Writer", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
pos	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
neu	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.

neu	GAME 6 (2006) *** Michael Keaton, Robert Downey, Jr., Bebe Neuwirth, Griffin Dunne, Catherine O'Hara, Harris Yulin, Tom Aldredge, Ari Graynor, Roger Rees, Shalom Harlow, Lillias White. (Dir: Michael Hoffman) "There's no crying in baseball!
pos	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
pos	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
pos	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
pos	His latest is no exception.
neu	Based on a story by acclaimed author Don DeLillo (who adapted the screenplay), Keaton stars as a New York bred playwright who's latest work is to dawn on the fated October 1986 evening of the World Series where his beloved Boston Red Sox' lifetime curse gets re-enforced by the infamous ball-between first baseman Bill Buckner's legs.
neu	But I'm getting ahead of myself.
pos	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
pos	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
pos	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
neu	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father ("The Sopranos" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
pos	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
pos	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
pos	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
pos	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.

neu	Don't misunderstand me.
neu	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
neu	How sad..because there are three theaters within 13 miles that could be playing it but are not.
neu	Warner Bros. keep doing this and good & faithful patrons will quit giving you their business.
neu	We deserve better than this.
neu	Theater operators say its the distributors fault and if that is true then I say boycott and just simply wait till these few good movies are out in video.
neu	We in the outlying areas seem to be treated as of lesser importance and are burdened with excessive trips just to see a select movie.
neu	Recently some stars even raised their ire over distributors failings as to getting a few select films out to the public.
neu	Come on Hollywood!
neu	Get your heads out of your film canisters and fulfill the moviegoers wants and needs.
neu	Why not?

books_pos_98
pos	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
neu	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
pos	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
neu	Other subjects may be more evident in our day than when first written, such as the manipulation of government officials by corporations for profits as with the US coalition and NATO armed forces current day practice of hiring private soldiers and service contractors as an integral part of their main fighting forces.
neu	This book is not anti-war, but anti-corruption and anti-interventionalist (anti-imperialism) and bemoans the abuse, destruction of so many good men/women (soldiers) both physically and mentally and the burden on society as a whole for the grossly disproportionate financial profits of a very few (olygarcy) whom by their very same actions should be considered quite unpatriotic.
neu	The book details the oppinion of a career military officer, a politically appointed general.
pos	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
pos	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
neu	True dialog is missing.
neg	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
neu	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
neu	The author often argues using emoutional language and metaphor.
neu	The naming of corporate sponsor of war as murderers is avoided but could be a concievable conclusion.
neu	Although critical of the illegal gains and abuses in which the author was paticipatory, this work is in no way an apology, nor a repentance for a full military career served.
pos	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
pos	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
neu	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
neu	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
pos	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
neu	The author insists bulling, coercion and imposition of other soveriegn nations (Imperialism) for corporate interests is immoral, conter-productive to national progress and contradictory to American values, especially when the uncoerced outcomes would result in the same benefits without the high costs of war (men, material, prestige).
neu	These high costs are the profits which feed the corporate war profiteering (aka racketeering).
pos	This book is useful for younger audiences.
neu	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
pos	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called "civil disobedience" for righteous causes.
neu	This book may be used to compare examples of civil rights abuses faced during 'McCarthism', the Civil Rights movement and the 'Patriot Act'.
pos	I recomend this book among others such as "Collateral Damage" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
neg	The graphic images from "The Horror of It" seem tame by today's standards.
neu	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
neu	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
pos	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
pos	For many it will confirm that "War is a Racket" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
neu	For those who are locked in patriotic vigor for a military action based on a percieved 'just cause', this testimony may add insight to a larger view of the possible reasons for why a nation would consider lingering in an unwanted, economically depleating and physically exhausting war considered long overdue to end.
neu	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
neg	The titles subtext of "Anti-war classic" is a bit misleading.
neu	The author was a career soldier who was politically appointed to general and excecuted his work so throughly well that he was decorated with high honors on multiple occasions and was an advocated for an impenetrable national defense.
neu	A better subtext for this work may be 'Taking the Profit Out of War' or 'Raising the Standard for Going to War' for the basic principles of the general was to reveal the manipulation of foreign governments by means of force, utilizing the full and combined powers of the United States armed forces and economic base in support of the gross avarice, greed and collusion of private corporate designs; both sides being aided and assisted by the economically and sensationalistically competative media propaganda machines.
neu	After reading this short book, I am reminded that it is often flattery and not fact that decieves us from the truth for which oppinion is truth enough for faith to act.
neu	I am remined of those with whom I live, from my own generation, who would cover their lies without accounting and how many of these sorts have risen to political power.
neu	I am reminded that the power of an individuals vote STILL provides the ultimate means of power ... that we are provide the means to our own ends and that our progress still remains within our hands, the means by which to thwart abuses of power and coruption and for setting higher standards living and accountability.
neu	This book supports my belief that it is vital to have a strong national defense in such a dangerous world, but that power does not need to equate to coercion, manipulation or abuse of others.
neu	I was inspired by the idea of the practical application of taking the incentives out of what should be called murder for profit or at least racketeering.
neu	Unless one can remember a bullies punch to the stomach in exchange for lunch money, Americans are fortunate to be free from feelings such imposed injustices.
neu	I am impressed even more that justice, liberty, freedom and democracy cannot function without a free, independant and vibrant media and that without such journalism to report the relevant and current facts to the people 'en mass', democracy cannot endure, let alone thrive.
neu	I am reminded that corporations are not patriotic and that profits do not express the true progress of a people and nation.
neu	I am impressed and amazed at how many of the most sinister of terms found in our vocabulary (racketeering, facism, coercion, murder) have lost our fear and concern.
neu	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
pos	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
neu	It reminds me that if someone needs to try so hard to convince you about somethin', that there must be somethin' wrong with it in the first place: the truth just seems to ring true.
neu	Propoganda is for sugar coatin' what is unadvisable.
neu	Encouragement is the only thing needed to motivate a good person to a just cause ... to do something difficult.
pos	I would say this book encourages.
pos	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.

pos	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
pos	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
pos	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
pos	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon – apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as "New York on steroids", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
pos	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the "Blade" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
pos	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
pos	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
pos	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!

pos	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
pos	The book tells one how to "get paid" in a spiritual way.
neu	The book proclaims that the Economic Revolution is the third phase of freedom after the Civil Rights Revolution.
neu	Economic Revolution is the methodology in which we go from where we are now (economic turmoil) to where we are financially independent in God's world.
pos	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
pos	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
neu	Some may see it as flip flopping while others may see it as a testament to the author's growth that he begins the book with an attitude that some may perceive to be that of an angry black man.
neu	He ends the book in what some might perceive as a kinder gentler African-American Republican, who believes that the American dream is possible for anyone who is willing to pick themselves up by their boot straps.
neg	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
pos	Still it's clear that the author loves his "people," and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
neu	He tells them why it's important for all people to learn a trade and become engaged in politics.
pos	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
neu	Hopefully in the future the author will considering updating and fattening up the book--to expand on his ideas.

neu	Fans have been clamoring for a sequel ever since it's release, and just last year their prayers were answered in film form, but does Advent Children capture the epic nature of the game?
neg	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
neu	Since my opinion of the film mirrors what many users have already mentioned I will keep this review shorter and to the point, listing the pros first followed by the cons.
pos	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
pos	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
pos	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief "bathing of Aeris" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
pos	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say "wow" at least once.
pos	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
neu	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
neu	Classical music is what is played throughout most of the movie, but some hard rock tracks are featured as well.
pos	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
neg	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
neu	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
neg	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
neg	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
neg	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
neg	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
neg	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
neg	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
neg	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
neg	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical "going no where" hubbub.
neu	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
neu	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
neu	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
neu	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
neu	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8

neu	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
neg	Cons: Horrible quality.
neg	Scratches way too easily.
neu	I've had this phone for a bit over four months.
neu	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.
neg	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
neg	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
neg	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
neg	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
neg	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
neg	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
neg	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
neg	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
neg	Now it wont charge at all.
neg	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.

music_neu_2
neu	As an 18 year college DJ in the early 70s, I played this album (per request) to death.
neu	I wore out my personal copy in my dorm room.
neu	But...is it a classic, defining piece of rock?
neu	Does this album stand with Tommy, Sergeant Peppers, and The Dark Side of the Moon?
neg	I don't think so.
neg	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
neu	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.

videogames_neu_9
pos	I really wanted to "love" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.
neu	How could this possibly have gone wrong?
neg	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
neg	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
neg	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
neg	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
neg	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
neu	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
neu	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
neu	There's also an RPG element to the game, which allows you to increase the levels of your Legions to give them more powerful and varied attacks.
neg	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
neu	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
pos	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
neg	Everyone else should steer clear.

neg	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.

neu	Oh well, the wait continues for Modern Warfare 2.

neu	SERAPHIM FALLS (2007) *** Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Angie Harmon, Anjelica Huston, Ed Lauter, Michael Wincott, Robert Baker, Kevin JO'Connor, Xander Berkeley, Wes Studi, James Jordan, Nate Mooney, Jimmi Simpson, Tom Noonan, Shannon Zeller. Vengeance has its price.
neu	The revenge Western has been around for quite some time – as long as revenge has been around I suppose (which may be redundant) – and the latest of this sub-genre owes quite a bit to John Ford's "The Searchers" and a kissing cousin to the Clint Eastwood revenge oater "The Outlaw Josey Wales'.
neu	In its latest incarnation, the story begins in the wintry confines of the Ruby Mountains circa 1868, and Gideon (a nearly unrecognizable Brosnan as far away from being The Artist Formerly Known As Bond here) is being pursued by a relentless tracker in the form of a taciturn man named Carver (low-key Neeson speaking volumes in his determined yet steely silent eyes), hell-bent on catching his fugitive, in tow with several hired guns to get the job done, by any means necessary.
pos	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.
neg	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
pos	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
pos	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
neu	There are a few tweaks to the genre's stock characters: young gun bank robbers; a railroad crew of hostile Irishmen and victimized Chinese slave labor; wise Indian proclaiming nuggets of choice phrasings; a snake-oil sales(wo)man (Huston at her slyest) who may-or- may-not-be-a-desert-mirage; and the off-beat missionaries on pilgrimage.
pos	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as "Numb3rs" & "CSI: NY") – who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques – manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
pos	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since "Unforgiven" and last year's "The Proposition".

pos	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.

electronics_neu_24
neu	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
neu	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
neg	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
neu	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
neu	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
neu	Being a person who likes natural light better than a flash, I always turned it off.
neg	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
neg	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
neu	Back to Ritz it went.
neg	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
neg	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
neg	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
neg	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
neg	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
neg	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
neg	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
neu	I guess you just have to live with it.
pos	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
pos	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
pos	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
pos	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
pos	4. The battery life is impressive.
pos	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
pos	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
pos	6. It's fast!
pos	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
pos	It's amazing.
neg	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
neg	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
neu	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
neu	Thus, you're always cursing about how you'd prefer to apply your own pressure to the brake.
neu	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.

neg	What a hoot!
neg	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
neu	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
neg	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
neg	There's even a chapter about developing a "magnetic eye!"
neu	The author whose real name was Albert Edgerly and who on occasion called himself Dr. Ralston, developed quite a loyal following during his day (1852-1926) among whom was William Danforth, the president of Purina, who even added Ralston to his company's name!

neu	KEANE (2005) **** Damian Lewis, Amy Ryan, Abigail Breslin.
neu	(Dir: Lodge Kerrigan) William Keane (played with heartbreaking brilliance by Lewis an Academy Award worthy turn) is a man wrestling with ultimate grief: he is searching for his lost little girl months after the incident that has sent him into a downward spiral into mental illness.
neu	Keane patrols the hustling bustling Port Authority Bus Terminal of New York City where he was with his daughter when he took his eyes off her for a brief moment only to lose her possibly forever.
pos	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
neu	He is met with disdain, indifference or plainly ignored.
neu	Keane is in hell.
neu	Living on a disability check and residing in a New Jersey flophouse Keane manages to daily sojourn back and forth hoping for a glimmer of recognition (is that her purple coat in the distance?)
neu	that he lathers himself into a feverish foam of hope (or worse fearful pessimism) and finds himself getting a cheap drunk on in a bar trying in vein to listen to "Sugar Pie Honey Bunch (Can't Help Myself)" on the tinny jukebox to either assure him or drown out his inner rage (unnervingly maddening); having anonymous sex with a stranger in a throbbing club's restroom; scoring cocaine to amp up his courage to go on; staggering the street howling his daughter's name and sadly returning to his empty room to sleep a dreamless, troubled sleep soothing himself between wracks of sobs of pity and horror.
pos	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
neu	Lynn informs Keane that she and her adorable daughter are en route to Albany but are awaiting her husband's word that he has located a new suitable home for the family.
neu	Keane recognizes in himself what he used to be – a father to a young girl – and becomes a defacto member of this temporary family when Lynn asks him to watch over Kira and the results are heartbreaking.
pos	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with "CLEAN, SHAVEN" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in "PULP FICTION") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
pos	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
pos	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
pos	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series "BAND OF BROTHERS" and was the best thing in "DREAMCATCHER", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
pos	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
pos	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
pos	The words "I love you" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
pos	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me "What do you think happens to him?"
pos	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
neu	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
pos	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.

neg	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks "realistic" or because it looks like a "simulation" might be deterred.
neg	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
neg	This is all in a game which claims to let you use "Real Military Tactics."
neg	Ridiculous stuff.
neg	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
neg	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
neg	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
neg	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for "real" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
neg	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
neg	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
neg	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
neu	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
pos	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
pos	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
neu	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
neu	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
neu	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.

neu	The X and Y of Buy is a book about gender marketing.
neu	Author Elizabeth Pace uses the scientific differences between men and women to help sales associates and entrepreneurs learn the best practices for dealing with different genders.
neu	the premise is; if you can market properly to men and women, you will be able to increase sales and expand your business.
pos	I really enjoyed this book.
pos	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
neu	She tells us things like men are more driven and strait forward when it comes to sales.
neu	They do not want interruptions and need to get right to the point.
neu	Women, on the other hand, want more connection and community when it comes to business relationships.
neu	Women will deal with (or add to) the conversations and interruptions if it means a group can come to a consensus.
neg	The only place I found this book lacking was in the "spiritual content" department.
neu	Thomas Nelson is a Christian publisher and prides itself on having a spiritual message.
neu	If they did not, I would not be picking at this point.
neu	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
neu	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
pos	Overall, it was a good book.

pos	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
pos	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
neu	When narrator sees an advertisement in a newspaper that claims that a master is seeking students who would like to save the world, he is angry and suspicious because his past has brought him in touch with many so called saviors interested only in their own glory.
neu	However, for some reason, he still goes to see the so called master.
neu	What he finds there terrifies and surprises him.
neu	But as he begins interacting with the master, Ishmael, he begins to realize that this is what he had been looking for all his life.
pos	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
neu	While we, the humans, homo sapien sapien, the most corrupt of all species, have regarded earth as land to be conquered and ruled, Ishmael tells the narrator that other animals, inclding the older species of humans like neanderthals didn't die out, they chose to step aside in order to let nature take its course.
pos	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
neu	So why the 3 stars?
neu	I have read Richard Bach, Dalai Lama and numberous other religous and philosophical texts.
neu	I have found that every author presents his or her view on life and evolution and future of mankind.
neu	But this is the world according to him.
neu	What is true for one man is not always true for rest of us.
neg	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
neg	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
pos	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.

neu	I'm going to be the exception to the flow of "thumbs up" fans of this K. Bacon movie.
neu	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
neg	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
neg	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes "Jason Bourne." Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and "they" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
neg	Where are the back-up?
neg	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
neg	This is only a smidgen of several "beyond belief" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
pos	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
neu	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
neg	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.

pos	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
pos	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
pos	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
pos	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
pos	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
pos	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
pos	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
pos	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
pos	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
neg	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
pos	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
pos	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
pos	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
neu	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
neu	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
pos	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
neu	Some people complain that other games have more.
neu	But in those other games, they are usually all too similar, they are just the same groups and have mostly the same stuff, but some of their stuff is stronger than other factions and some weaker (maybe their air attack is strong but their troops weak).
neu	This usually makes only one or two factions dominant, as one aspect tends to be overpowering.
pos	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
pos	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
pos	Any race can truly beat any race.
pos	The graphics are sweet.
pos	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
neu	The simple fact of RTS games is that graphics aren't that important anyway.
neu	True, you like to be able to distinguish your units, but for the most part it's kind of like chess, who cares what they look like; you only care what they do.
pos	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
neu	It just isn't a big deal to me in an RTS.

neg	"Disastrous" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
neg	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
neg	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
neg	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
neg	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
neg	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
neg	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!

neu	"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" is a story of an autistic teenager who is excellent with numbers and has a photographic memory but lacks communication skills.
neu	His view of the world is simple: if it is not true, it is a lie.
neu	If he doesn't know a person, he shouldn't talk to him or her.
neu	If it is yellow or brown, it can't be touched.
neu	And nobody, not his father, not even his mother can touch him.
pos	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
pos	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!
neu	When Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone finds a murdered dog in his neighbors's frontyard, he picks him up instinctively.
neu	That is because he likes dogs.
neu	The neighbor assumes he killed the dog and from there start's Christopher's long and arduous journey to find the killer and unravel the mystery.
neu	However, in doing so, Christopher finds more than he had bargained for.
neu	His simple autistic mind cannot comprehend why anybody would kill a dog.
neu	While the answer, which he uncovers by the middle of the book, makes no sense, it does bring him face to face with the surprising truth about his dead mother and that ultimately convinces him to travel to London. Now begins the story of a boy, a child, who hasn't stepped beyond his street alone but travels boldly all the way to a metropolis where even adults with all their sense and knowledge of the world can get lost.
neu	Does he make it?
neu	What happens to the killer of the dog?
neu	What was the secret about his mother?
neu	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
neg	This is a very one dimensional book.
neg	The story didn't seem to be very original.
neg	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
neg	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
neu	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
neg	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
neu	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
neg	Very one dimensional.
neu	Read a few pages before you buy it.

neu	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
neu	I bought a Lexmark All in one x2470 with a gift card i got for Christmas last year.
neg	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
neg	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
neg	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
neg	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
neu	I will let you know the out come if that is allowed.
